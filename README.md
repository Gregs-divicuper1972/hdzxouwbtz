Man, you wouldn’t believe the weird weekend I had. Just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this  , Antes del cuerpo, and honestly, I’m all over the place right now. It’s one of those flicks that makes you question what's even real, you know? Like, I’m sitting there thinking, “Am I even awake or is this just a dream?” Great stuff though, seriously intense visuals, and the soundtrack? Killer vibes.

But damn, being a head chef lately has been crazy. Lunch rushes feel like they're never gonna end. Anyway, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this made me realize I need to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 more stuff like this—it's like the perfect escape from chopping onions all day. Haha. It’s kind of like cooking in a way? You start with these raw ingredients, mix 'em up, create something incredible, and sometimes you even end up crying.

> So, this one scene got me thinking about how delicate everything is in life and it hit hard after the kitchen madness today. Like, the precision we have in the kitchen is just like, a single screw-up and everything collapses—it's intense, man. The way they handled those moments of silence vs. chaos was kinda genius.

Anyway, if you get the chance, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , seriously. Just make sure you’re awake and not overcooked from a shift, lol. Oh, and speaking of chaos, you remember Maria from the front of house? She brought up some wild rumor about a new sous chef joining. Guess they might be concocting something, haha.

Alright, I’m rambling. Need to get some sleep before getting back to the kitchen tomorrow. My mind is still swirling like a perfect risotto but whatever. Let's catch up over coffee soon, yeah?
